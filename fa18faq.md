# Frequently Asked Questions for the Fall 2018 Data 100

**Q. Who are the course instructors?**

**A.** The course will be taught by Fernando Perez and Josh Hug.

**Q. My question isn't answered in this FAQ, what can I do?**

**A.** Preferably, phrase your question in a way that isn't personally identifiable and file it as a [new issue in this repository](https://github.com/DS-100/DS-100.github.io/issues/new). We will then add a response to the FAQ, thus benefitting you and all other students with similar concerns.

If it's really something completely specific to your personal situation that can't be addressed in a public forum, contact the instructors by email.

**Q. I wasnâ€™t able to officially enroll, why?**

**A.** The enrollment system as currently configured will only allow you to enroll if you meet **all** of the requirements below:

- Completion of Data 8.

- Completion of CS61A or CS88 or Engineering 7.

- Completion or current enrollment in EE16A or Math54 or Stat 89A. Note: You must add EE16A or Math54 or Stat89A before DS100, otherwise the course enrollment system will not allow you to enroll.

**Q. How can I enroll in the course if I have not met the exact list of
requirements above?**

**A.** You must:

1. Join the course waitlist.

1. Fill out the [enrollment appeals
   form](https://goo.gl/forms/SIH49z8JE8VrvNbk1), which certifies that you will
   have the needed background knowledge to succeed in CS100.

Broadly speaking, the pre/corequisites listed above represent fundamentals in
three areas: Statistics, Python Programming, and Linear Algebra. Statistics and
Python Programming are prerequisites which must be completed before the course.
Linear Algebra is a corequisite, which may be completed before or concurrently
with the course.  However, even if you do not satisfy these conditions exactly,
you can still be enrolled in the course, so long as you accept the
responsibility for understanding all needed prerequisite knowledge.

[**Enrollment appeals form**](https://goo.gl/forms/SIH49z8JE8VrvNbk1).

**Q. If I fill out this form, how will my enrollment be processed?**

**A.** Students who meet the pre/coreqs will be enrolled first, then space permitting, those who filled out the form will be admitted according to the order of the waitlist.

Form signatories will be processed for the first time after Phase I enrollment is completed for all continuing students.  We will update this FAQ with an exact date soon.

**Q. I was not able to add to the waitlist, why?**

**A.**

- Did you mark the box to Add to the Waiting List if course is full?
- Did you select 999 as your lab and 999A as your discussion?
- Is the waiting list full?

**Q. I tried to enroll and received a message saying I'm on the waitlist, the reason being "Available seats are reserved and you do not meet any requirements for the reserved seats.". I see many open seats available, what is going on?**

**A.** You don't meet the requirements, see Q. above about waitlist processing.

**Q. I have a time conflict and can not attend 2/3 of the lectures. What are my options?**

**A.** The attendance policy gives you two options:

1. Attendance 5%, final exam 30%.
1. Attendance 0%, final exam 35%.

**Q. On the course enrollment, I noticed that students are unable to enroll in a lab/discussions section. For the enrollment process, will students mark the "TBA" option in order to enroll and once they are accepted into the course will they get to choose a lab/discussion section?**

**A.** All students will enroll in a single lab/discussion 'generic' section, and at the beginning of the semester we will run a survey to allocate everyone to their preferred time slots. We've done this in the past and while we can't guarantee that 100% of the students will get their #1 pick, most people do get one of their top one or two picks, so it works well in practice.

**Q. What is the status of the L&S Data Science Major and/or Minor?**

**A.** As you plan your classes for fall, the Division of Data Sciences hopes and expects that the L&S Data Science Major will be available to students in the fall.  You can learn more about the current status of the Major (and Minor) on [this website](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba).  Frequently Asked Questions about the Major and Minor are [discussed here](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/faqs).  The [Data001 Piazza site](https://piazza.com/class/j7s01y165odq5?cid=496) will reopen later for you to ask questions from advising staff as they are hired.  At this time we (your Data 100 staff) do not have any further information.

**Q. I know that each student's experience in the class may vary, but what do students find to be the most challenging aspect of the course?**

**A.** This varies a lot: for some it's the programming, for others the mathematics, for others the statistical reasoning.

**Q Are students expected to or should they come into the class with knowledge/skills beyond the prerequisites (e.g. additional computer science/statistics courses)?**

**A.** A solid mastery of the material in the official prerequisites should suffice to succeed in the course.

**Q. How difficult has it been for students to enroll into CS/Stat 100 in past semesters?**

**A.** We've been growing the course capacity to accommodate the demand.  In spring 2018, most, if not all who wanted to enroll were eventually able to do so (if not right at the start).
