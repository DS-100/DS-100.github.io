# Frequently Asked Questions for the Fall 2018 Data 100

**Q. Who are the course instructors?**

**A.** The course will be taught by Fernando Perez and Josh Hug.

**Q. I wasnâ€™t able to officially enroll, why?**

**A.** The enrollment system will only allow you to enroll if you meet
**all** of the requirements below:

-   Completion of Engineering 7 or Data 8.

-   Completion of CS61A or CS88.

-   Completion or current enrollment in EE16A or Math54. Note: You must add EE16A or Math54 before DS100, otherwise the course enrollment system will not allow you to enroll.

**Q. How can I enroll in the course if I have not met the exact list of
requirements above?**

**A.** An appeals form will be released for students 
who want to enroll who have not met the formal prerequisites above.

Details TBA. 

**Q. What is the status of the L&S Data Science Major and/or Minor?**

**A.** As you plan your classes for fall, the Division of Data Sciences hopes and expects that the L&S Data Science Major will be available to students in the fall.  You can learn more about the current status of the Major (and Minor) on [this website](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba).  Frequently Asked Questions about the Major and Minor are [discussed here](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/faqs).  The [Data001 Piazza site](https://piazza.com/class/j7s01y165odq5?cid=496) will reopen later for you to ask questions from advising staff as they are hired.  At this time we (your Data 100 staff) do not have any further information.

**Q. I know that each student's experience in the class may vary, but what do students find to be the most challenging aspect of the course?**

**A.** This varies a lot: for some it's the programming, for others the mathematics, for others the statistical reasoning.
 
**Q Are students expected to or should they come into the class with knowledge/skills beyond the prerequisites (e.g. additional computer science/statistics courses)?**

**A.** A solid mastery of the material in the official prerequisites should suffice to succeed in the course.

**Q. How difficult has it been for students to enroll into CS/Stat 100 in past semesters?**
 
**A.** We've been growing the course capacity to accommodate the demand.  In spring 2018, most, if not all who wanted to enroll were eventually able to do so (if not right at the start).
