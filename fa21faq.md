# Frequently Asked Questions for Fall Data 100

**Data 100 will be taught in hybrid mode for the fall 2021 semester**

* Lectures will be pre-recorded and available online before the scheduled lecture time.
* There will be _both_ in-person and online options for discussions, labs and office hours.
* The midterm exam will be offered online, but DSP students and those with specific needs who require an in-person exam will be offered that option. We will provide a form to coordinate with those who need to take the exam in-person. To ensure fairness, the conditions of the exam will be as identical as possible in both settings.
* The above means that **time conflicts should not be an issue for anyone.**

**Q. What are the official prerequisites for this course?**

**A.** The official list of prerequisites is:

- Data 8.

- CS 61A or CS88 or Engineering 7. We strongly recommend either CS 61A or CS 88.

- EE 16A or Math 54 or Stat 89A. This may be satisfied concurrently with Data 100, but we strongly recommend that you finish a linear algebra course before taking Data 100.

**Q. Will the official prerequisites be enforced?**

**A.** The official prerequisites will _are being strictly enforced by CDSS_.  Decisions on any requests for exceptions to this policy are being made by the [CDSS advisors team](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/student-services) and you must communicate directly with them - _do not email instructors about this_ as we are not making these decisions at all.

**Q. I Have a time conflict for the final, what can I do?**

**A.** The course will have a final group project in lieu of a final exam, so there will be no issues regarding this.
--- 

**Q. What is the proctoring policy given the online nature of the course?**

**A.** We will offer each exam on two timezones, to be taken synchronously. No Zoom/video proctoring will be used, but we will deploy multiple measures to detect cheating and will enforce the campus policies aggressively, including severe grade penalties and reporting to the Office of Student Conduct for further disciplinary action.

---

**Q. What is the alternate exam policy?**

**A.** Each exam will be offered in two timeslots, roughly corresponding to the morning and evening in Pacific Time, to accommodate for timezone differences. Everyone must be able to make one of these two timeslots; we will not be offering additional alternates to accommodate for class conflicts.

---

**Q. When will the full schedule of labs and discussions be announced?**

**A.** We are still developing the schedule and logistics; we will post a complete version by the first day of class.
