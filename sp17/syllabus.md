### Feature Engineering, Over-fitting, and Cross Validation [Gonzalez]
In this lecture we will begin to do some machine learning.  We will explore how simple linear techniques can be used to address complex non-linear relationships on a wide range of data types.

### Finish Discussion on Spark and Classification

In the previous lectures we moved quickly through some important concepts in distributed data processing and classification.  Because both of these ideas are critical in many data science applications, we will return to the discussion on Spark and review how the relational operators we learned earlier in the class enable scalable distributed computing.  We will then return to the topic of classification and review logistic regression and how it can be made to run in a distributed computing environment.  Time permitting we will touch on Deep Learning as a generalization of the ideas in logistic regression.

A little script to highlight the week that is next

There is currently a bug in this script which someone needs to fix.  When I wrote this script for my graduate seminar class we only had one lecture a week. We should modify the Jekyll code to render the syllabus with each row tagged so we can automatically identify the week and lecture day.

-->



<script type="text/javascript">
var current_date = new Date();
var rows = document.getElementsByTagName("th");
var finished =  false;
for (var i = 1; i < rows.length && !finished; i++) {
   var r = rows[i];
   if (r.id.startsWith("counter_")) {
      var fields = r.id.split("_")
      var week_div_id = "week_" + fields[2]
      var lecture_date = new Date(fields[1] + " 23:59:00")
      if (current_date <= lecture_date) {
         finished = true;
         r.style.background = "orange"
         r.style.color = "black"
         var week_td = document.getElementById(week_div_id)
         week_td.style.background = "#043361"
         week_td.style.color = "white"
      }
   }
}
</script>
