    "In this assignment we will study a fundamental problem in crawling the web: *deciding when to re-index changing pages*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines like those deployed at Google and Microsoft periodically visit, or *crawl*, web pages to check their current status and record any changes to the page.  Some pages, such as news websites, are updated frequently while other pages, [like this one](http://youvegotmail.warnerbros.com/cmp/0frameset.html), are never updated. \n",

    "**Why not crawl the entire web all the time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The web is **big** and even giant search engines don't have the resources to re-read the entire web continuously.  Fortunately, different sites change at different rates, so an intuitive strategy would be to visit sites more if they are changed more frequently.  But this requires us to know, or at least estimate, how often each web site is changed.  This is the main question you'll answer in this assignment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Along the way you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* do some EDA to understand the site dataset.\n",

    "* use simulation to get a concrete understanding of your models.\n",

Every hour, each page was downloaded, and it was determined whether the page had been changed since the previous hour.  For the first hour, we can't tell whether it has changed, so there are 719 such \"checks\" for each page.\n",

    "**Important fact about the data:** Not every check succeeded.  Sometimes the page failed to load, or it was otherwise impossible to tell whether it had changed since the previous hour.  These hours are **omitted** from the dataset.  A field in the dataset indicates the number of successful checks for each page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in JSON format in the file `crawl.json`.  For each page, we have: the URL, called `url`; the number of successful visits to the page, `number of checks`; and the checks when a change was detected, called `positive checks`.  Examine the `crawl.json` file.  You might find it convenient to load it into python using `json.load`.  The next cell two cells are provided for that."
