    "In this assignment, you'll use cloud computing to cluster picture data.  To do this, you will learn to use a popular cloud computing framework called Spark, which was developed at Berkeley.  We'll be using a service called Databricks to develop and run code.  Databricks simplifies the setup of Spark and the cloud, and it provides limited free cloud computing.  Outside the context of this assignment, you can always run Spark code on your own computer or in the cloud without Databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning goals:\n",
    "1. Get a crash course in Spark.\n",
    "2. Implement the k-means algorithm on a real dataset.\n",
    "3. Use visualization to understand the data and your clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is to create a Databricks account.  Go [here](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/registration.html#signup/community) to sign up.  Use your @berkeley email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up, sign in to your Databricks account, then click Workspace -> Users -> `<your-username>@berkeley.edu`.  Right-click to create a folder called `hw7`.  Navigate to the folder.  Right-click, click Import, and import the `hw7.dbc` file in the folder containing this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "The rest of this assignment is primarily conducted in the Databricks notebook.  However, this notebook contains the OK tests you can use to check your work, and it contains the invocations to submit your assignment when you're done.  Follow the instructions in the Databricks notebook to download your results in a form that the tests here will understand."
