    "# Homework 2: Language in the 2016 Presidential Election\n",
    "Popular figures often have help managing their media presence.  In the 2016 election, Twitter was an important communication medium for every major candidate.  Many Twitter posts posted by the top two candidates were actually written by their aides.  You might wonder how this affected the content or language of the tweets.\n",

    "Along the way, you'll get a first look at Pandas.  Pandas is a Python package that provides a `DataFrame` data structure similar to the `datascience` package's `Table`, which you might remember from Data 8.  `DataFrame`s are a bit harder to use than `Table`s, but they provide more advanced functionality and are a standard tool for data analysis in Python."

Once you're done with your analysis, you may find it interesting to see whether `R` is easier to use for this task."
