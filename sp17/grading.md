The following is a _tentative_ grading policy and may change slightly as circumstances dictate. 

There will be 7 challenging homeworks assignments.  Homeworks must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer questions.  At the end of each week of instruction we will have an online multiple choice quiz that will help you stay up-to-date with lecture materials. Labs assignments will be graded for completion and are intended to help with the homework assignments.

* 40% Homeworks
* 13% Vitamins
* 7% Labs
* 15% Midterm
* 25% Final

In addition, active participation on Piazza and in class may positively affect your final grade.


### On Time Policy (try not to be late)

Each student gets an extension budget of 5 days worth of slip-time. 
You can use the extension on homework assignments during the semester. 
Do not plan to use your slip-time; it is there for unforeseen circumstances! 
After you have used up your slip-time budget, any assignment handed in late will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number of days. 
No assignment will be accepted more then 5 days late.


### Collaboration Policy (don't cheat)

Data science is a collaborative activity.
While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually.
If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your solution.
Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final.
We will be following the [EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/policies#dishonesty), so be sure you are familiar with it.
