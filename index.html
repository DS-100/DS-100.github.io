  <h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand the world.
This intermediate level class bridges between <a href="http://data8.org/fa16/">Data 8</a> and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields.
</p>

<p>
In this class, we will explore the data science life-cycle, including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical inference and prediction​, and decision-making.​ This class focuses on quantitative critical thinking​ and key principles and techniques needed to carry out this cycle. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.
</p>

<!-- <p>
This course is a gateway to upper division courses in both the foundations and the application of data science principles and techniques.
We expect that DS100 will be widely enrolled by students in many majors, as well as graduate students in many fields.
In this first offering of the class we will keep enrollment relatively small, around 96, to enable closer interaction with students as challenges arise.  We expect later offerings to be substantially larger.

      <h4>Initial Offering Spring 2017</h4>
      <p>
      This is the first "beta" offering of DS100 and will have limited enrollment.  To learn more visit the <a href="sp17"> Spring 2017 Course Website </a>

    <!--   <h4>Call for Datasets</h4>
      <p>
        One of our goals is for this class to use exciting, relevant, and new datasets that will help illustrate the principles and demonstrate new techniques. If you or somebody you know has data that they want to share please let us know.
